# arjuna

version 0.1.1-u02 now keeps track of dandas and mahurtas.  it runs for 2 mahurtas before exiting.  Also, a file ".kala" is populated with the current amount of minutes elapsed.
=======
version 0.1.1 of Arjuna is now finished.  This version extends the runtime to 5 minutes before exiting the application.  Also, a public method to the Arjuna class has been added that returns the number of minutes that have elapsed since the construction of the Arjuna class.  As development continues, the goal of the Arjuna class is becoming more clearly defined as a simple time tracking class that will expose time tracking statistics to both other java classes, and to the external file system.
=======
Arjuna is the conqeror of sleep.  Here at version 0.0.3, the Arjuna module simply closes automatically after three seconds.  Meanwhie the elapsed time since the construction of the Arujuna class is repeatedly outputed to the system console.
=======
Arjuna is the conqueror of sleep.  Wherever there is Krishnaand Arjuna, there is assured victory.  The Arjuna class has thusfar only one method, the ability to keep time (Kala).  The structure of the code needs to be readjusted to make the private Kala properties to be outside the keepKala method or someother slight re-organization.
