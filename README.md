Arjuna is the conqueror of sleep.  Wherever there is Krishnaand Arjuna, there is assured victory.  The Arjuna class has thusfar only one method, the ability to keep time (Kala).  The structure of the code needs to be readjusted to make the private Kala properties to be outside the keepKala method or someother slight re-organization.
